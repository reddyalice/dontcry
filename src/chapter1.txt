Starts in the "Afterlife"
Cat walks in and starts to ask questions regarding the place
great when I started to write this I accidentally dropped the glass of water now there is glass shards everywhere
great start idiot
okay cleaned up the glass now can continue
should it be 2d or 3d for this scene? I think I will figure something out
I guess one of the tiny glass shards got into my finger, it hurts
